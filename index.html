  <h1>Biography</h1>
  <p>Prospective physics major with a background in computational and competition physics 
    and an interest in nuclear and particle physics, 
    seeking to gather knowledge and contribute through research to the fundamental science.
    As a high school student graduating early and taking a gap year, I still haven't started undergrad, 
    but that doesn't mean I'm lacking experience.</p>

    <a href="https://slabii.github.io/transcript.pdf">transcript</a>.</p>

  <h1>Physics Olympiad</h1>
  <p>Yearly nationwide physics problem-solving competition with roughly 6000 participants</p>

  <p>Helpful <a href="https://libgen.rs">link</a> for finding textbooks</p>
  <p>Simulation lab I wrote: here is the <a href="https://slabii.github.io/pendulum_lab.pdf">problem statement</a>, 
   and here is the <a href="https://slabii.github.io/pendulum_lab.xcarchive.zip">program</a>(Mac only). Unfortunately, I haven't gotten the program to work as a standalone executable. In order to use the program, please download Xcode, unzip the program, double-click the program (which will open it as an archive in Xcode), click "Distribute Content", verify that "Built Products" is selected, click "Next", choose a file path, then go to that file path and double-click your way through all of the folders until you find the executable.</p>
