  <h1>Biography</h1>
  <p>Prospective physics major with a background in computational and competition physics 
    and an interest in nuclear and particle physics, 
    seeking to gather knowledge and contribute through research to the fundamental science.
    As a high school student graduating early and taking a gap year, I still haven't started undergrad, 
    but that doesn't mean I'm lacking experience.</p>
