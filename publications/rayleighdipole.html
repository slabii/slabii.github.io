	<p>
		We explore Mie scattering by a homogeneous, spherical particle of radius much smaller 
		than the wavelength of light and a complex refractive index. When the medium refractive 
		index is a real number equal to the real part of the particle refractive index, the 
		effective particle refractive index is of the form 1 + 𝑖𝜅. In this case, scattering is 
		caused solely by the imaginary part 𝜅 of the particle refractive index, resembling Rayleigh 
		scattering at small values and perfect conductor scattering at large values of 𝜅. We 
		employ a Mie computer program to simulate the scattering in this case; we plot the results 
		and see that as 𝜅 increases, the scattering of s-polarized light becomes more anisotropic, 
		the backscattering intensity brightens while the forward scattering intensity dims. To 
		explain our results theoretically, we explore how the Mie equations reduce for constraints 
		of size parameter 𝑥 ≪ 1 and a refractive index of the form 𝑚 = 1 + 𝑖𝜅, though our analysis 
		holds for arbitrary 𝑚 so long as 𝑅𝑒(𝑚𝑥) ≪ 1. We find that such small particles may be 
		described by a dipole with appropriate electric and magnetic dipole moments. Simple equations 
		are given describing the scattering by these particles. Finally, we supplement our results 
		with diagrams visualizing why we see the pattern found.
