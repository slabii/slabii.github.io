# Biography
Prospective physics major student with a background in computational physics and an interest in nuclear and particle physics, seeking to gather knowledge and contribute through research to the study of physics. As a high school student graduating early and taking a gap year, I still haven't started undergrad, but that doesn't mean I'm lacking experience. <br><br>
