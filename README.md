# Biography
Prospective physics major with a background in computational and competition physics and an interest in nuclear and particle physics, seeking to gather knowledge and contribute through research to the fundamental science. As a high school student graduating early and taking a gap year, I still haven't started undergrad, but that doesn't mean I'm lacking experience. <br><br>

# Physics Olympiad
Nationwide physics competition with roughly 6000 total contestants<br>

Simulation lab I wrote: [here](https://slabii.github.io/pendulum_lab.pdf) is the problem statement, and [here](https://slabii.github.io/pendulum_lab.xcarchive.zip) is the program (Mac only). Unfortunately, I haven't gotten the program to work as a standalone executable. In order to use the program, please download Xcode, unzip the program, double-click the program (which will open it as an archive in Xcode), click "Distribute Content", verify that "Built Products" is selected, click "Next", choose a file path, then go to that file path and double-click your way through all of the folders until you find the executable. <br>
